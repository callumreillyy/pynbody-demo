# pynbody-demo

This repo is a demonstartion of the [pynbody quickstart](https://pynbody.readthedocs.io/latest/tutorials/quickstart.html) walkthrough. It covers the basic functionality of the pynbody library and includes some notes from me.

## Setup

After cloning the repo, create a virtural environment and install dependencies. Remember to deactivate :D.

```bash
    python3 -m venv pynbody-topsy-venv
    source pynbody-topsy-venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    deactivate # once finsished
```

Once dependencies are installed run `load_test_data.py` to install the pynbody test data (this make take a while...).

## Usage

In `/demos` run any of the python scripts from the command line and follow the prompts. Open the code in and IDE and make some visualisations, create profiles, try a new halo etc.
